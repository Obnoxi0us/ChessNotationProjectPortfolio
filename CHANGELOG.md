I created four Java files for my Chess Notation component: ChessNotation.java, ChessNotation1.java, ChessNotationKernel.java, and ChessNotationSecondary.java. Within the ChessNotationKernel class, I developed six methods to manage the chess game data:

1. addTurn()
2. removeTurn()
3. numberOfTurns()
4. addMetadata()
5. removeMetadata()
6. hasMetadata()
Additionally, in the ChessNotationSecondary.java file, I implemented a boolean method to compare objects: equals().
